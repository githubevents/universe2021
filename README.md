## The global developer event
Thanks for joining us for [GitHub Universe 2021](https://githubuniverse.com/).

Connect with the people and tech defining the industry. Build skills, explore new tools, and celebrate the developer community over two days of live, interactive, and on demand content.

## Watch live

Join us and [watch the live stream here](https://githubuniverse.com/). All of the sessions will be available on demand after the event.

## Join the discussion

[Chat live now!!](https://github.com/githubevents/universe2021/discussions)

We've enabled Discussions here for you to ask and answer questions about each session as well as connect with one another during the event. Engineering teams and GitHub experts across the world will be online during each of the sessions.

During each session our hosts will be picking questions from this discussions space to ask the presenter as part of the live-stream, so please do join in!

Remember, we want to keep the discussions' area a friendly and welcoming place for everyone taking part in the event, and **focused specifically and solely on the topic(s) covered in the GitHub Universe sessions**. Therefore, please respect the [Event Code of Conduct]( https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-event-code-of-conduct)  and be wonderful to each other.

This is a civilized place for connecting with other event attendees, and Hubbers from across the world taking part in the events. By participating in this community, you are agreeing to the same [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service) that apply to GitHub.com, as well as the GitHub Event [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/githubevents/Universe2021/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

🤞🏽We aim to do our best to answer most questions, but it's possible not all questions will get answered. The discussion area will be for live interaction and Q&A for session themes and topics. We will be locking the discussions to make them read-only after the event so you’ll be able to refer back to them after Universe has commenced.
